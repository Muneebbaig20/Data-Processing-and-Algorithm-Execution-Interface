# Data Processing and Algorithm Execution Interface

## Overview

The **Data Processing and Algorithm Execution Interface** is a Python-based GUI application built using **Tkinter**. It allows users to generate input files with random data for two different algorithms (closest pair distance and large integer multiplication) and execute these algorithms on input files. The application provides a simple and interactive interface to generate files and run algorithms efficiently.

## Features

- **Generate Input Files**: Allows users to generate input files for coordinate pairs and large integer multiplication.
  - **Coordinate File**: Generates random coordinates (x, y) for a specified number of pairs.
  - **Multiplication File**: Generates random integer pairs for large integer multiplication.

- **Run Algorithms**: After generating input files, users can execute two algorithms:
  - **Closest Pair Distance**: Calculates the shortest distance between any two coordinate pairs using divide-and-conquer and brute-force methods.
  - **Integer Multiplication**: Performs multiplication of large integers using the Karatsuba algorithm.

- **Graphical User Interface**: The app uses Tkinter to provide an easy-to-use GUI for file generation and algorithm execution.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Usually bundled with Python)
- Math library (Standard Python library)
